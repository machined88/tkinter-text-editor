# Tkinter Text Editor
A very basic text editor made with tkinter.

Features
---------
Only very basic functionalities you would expect from a text editor such as edit, save, save as and create a new file. I also added a word count tool just for fun, nothing fancy.

Usage
-----
Run the following command on your terminal :
```
python main.py
```
